# neuron-scratch-pytorch-tensorflow
Classification is done single neuron, with sigmoid activation function; which acts as ligistics regression. Three datasets are used: 2D linear separable, 2D nonlinear separable and cat/non-cat images.

Directories are named after these datasets. Within each directory of dataset, neuron algorithm is implemented in three ways i.e; vanilla python, pytorch and tensorflow. Pytorch and tensorflow have low-level and high-level APIs. So there are different ways and styles to implement using frameworks. File convention of wxploring different ways is described in picture below:
